 * Facebook interviewers like this question and propose it in four main variations. The choice of algorithm should be based on the input format:
 *
 * 1. Strings. Use schoolbook digit-by-digit addition.
 *    Note, that to fit into constant space is not possible for languages with immutable strings,
 *      for example, for Java and Python. Here are two examples:
 *
 *  @see com.leetcode._67_AddBinary: sum two binary strings.
 *  @see com.leetcode._415_AddStrings: sum two non-negative numbers in a string representation without converting them to integers directly.
 *
 * 2. Integers. Usually, the interviewer would ask you to implement a sum without using + and - operators.
 *    Use bit manipulation approach. Here is an example:
 *
 *  @see com.leetcode._371_SumOfTwoIntegers: Sum two integers without using + and - operators.
 *
 * 3. Arrays. The same textbook addition. Here is an example:
 *
 *  @see com.leetcode._989_AddToArrayFormOfInteger
 *
 * 4. Linked Lists. Sentinel Head + Textbook Addition. Here are some examples:
 *
 *  @see com.leetcode._66_PlusOne
 *  @see com.leetcode._2_AddTwoNumbers
 *  @see com.leetcode._445_AddTwoNumbersII
