Medium. Tree, Depth-First Search, Binary Tree.

Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA)
of two given nodes, p and q. If either node p or q does not exist in the tree,
return null. All values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: "The lowest common ancestor
of two nodes p and q in a binary tree T is the lowest node that has both p
and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself)".
A descendant of a node x is a node y that is on the path from node x to some leaf node.

Example 1:
 Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
 Output: 3
 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

Example 2:
 Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
 Output: 5
 Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5.
  A node can be a descendant of itself according to the definition of LCA.

Example 3:
 Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 10
 Output: null
 Explanation: Node 10 does not exist in the tree, so return null.

Constraints:
 The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 10^4].
 -10‚Åπ^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9
 All Node.val are unique.
 p != q
